<h1>IronBoots - Order Management App - SoftUni</h1>
<h2>WIP</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>An MVC order management app that implements 3 user roles - Admin, Client and Manager. A client is able to see the products and their price, add them to cart and place orders. They can also see order and product details but cannot make any changes.</p>
<p>A manager can see materials, products, orders, shipments and vehicles, and also add any one of those except for orders.</p>
<p>An Admin can see all items in the base and edit them/add new ones(excl orders)</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>The application allows users to place orders and track them. To take care of the delivery, managers can manage the shipments and vehicles.</p>
<p>When an shipment is assigned a date, the program automatically changes the availability of the vehicles and changes the status of the shipment accordingly.</p>
